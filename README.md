# Telegram-scams
Greetings! This project will look at popular types of fraud in telegram, and the code for these tools will also be posted here. P.S.: I am not responsible for the actions that you may take with these utilities, I post these files as experiments and observations.
Well, my nickname is Dr.Firewall and this is the first entry. Recently, I personally had to deal with telegram fraud, after which I decided to explore this topic and share it with you. Perhaps I'll start with the "demolition" of telegram accounts. Recently, scammers have begun to intimidate a lot of neutral people.

## Introduction

This project examines popular types of fraud occurring on Telegram. The code for the tools used in these scams will be shared here for educational purposes.

## Personal Experience

Recently, I encountered Telegram fraud firsthand. This experience motivated me to explore and share insights on this topic. Let's begin with the issue of **Telegram account "demolition"** — a growing concern as scammers increasingly target neutral individuals.

## Common Scam Methodology

Scammers typically follow this pattern:

1. **Initial Contact**  
   They reach out via games or other online resources, targeting both children and adults.

2. **Luring to Telegram**  
   They invite the victim to Telegram with tempting offers (e.g., free money or in-game items).

3. **Gathering Information**  
   They request direct communication on Telegram to extract account registration data and the user's **account ID**.

4. **Data Harvesting**  
   Using specialized utilities, they collect personal information about the victim.

5. **Controlled Dialogue**  
   Initially polite, they maintain scripted conversations. However, if the victim deviates, the tone shifts.

6. **Demonstrating "Power"**  
   They reveal personal data (e.g., email addresses, recently visited websites) to intimidate the victim — even if the data is publicly available or falsified.

7. **Threatening Phase**  
   Scammers issue dire warnings:
   - Physical harm ("You'll end up in the hospital").
   - Legal trouble ("You'll go to jail").
   - Financial exploitation ("We'll use your cards for illegal activity").

8. **Psychological Impact**  
   The victim may experience:
   - Severe anxiety.
   - Apathy.
   - In extreme cases, suicidal thoughts.

9. **Ransom Demand**  
   Finally, they demand payment in exchange for:
   - "Protecting" the victim's data.
   - Preserving the victim's Telegram account.

## Next Steps

Tomorrow, I will:
- Share a **sample code** received from a scammer.
- Explain how the code operates.

In future entries, we will:
- Analyze other tools scammers use to harvest data.
- Discuss practical methods to protect yourself.

Stay tuned for more insights!
